# Spotify Clone Project

This project is a **Spotify Clone** created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It is a static replica of the popular music streaming platform Spotify's UI. This clone provides a user interface similar to the original, allowing users to explore a music library and navigate through various sections, such as playlists, albums, and tracks.

## About

This is a personal project where I tried to replicate the look and feel of Spotify using basic web technologies such as HTML and CSS. It is purely static and doesn't feature the functionalities of the actual Spotify app, but it serves as an excellent exercise in UI/UX design, layout, and responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The project is fully responsive, and it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Spotify UI Replica**: It closely mimics the Spotify homepage, featuring a top navigation bar, sidebar, and content area with albums, playlists, and tracks.
- **CSS Styling**: The project uses modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid to create an attractive and responsive design.
